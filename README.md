# Product Review and Recommendation System

## Description:
Our project builds an e-commerce application which enhances the customer experience by providing insights that are relevant to their needs and interests, ultimately leading to increased sales and revenue for businesses. We have used the data from Kaggle website ‘Amazon Sales’ as the database for our application. We have used the data and visualizations to show the distribution of data and compare the products.
